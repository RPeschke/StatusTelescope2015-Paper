The telescope performance has been validated at CERN (120\,GeV pions) and DESY (1 to 6\,GeV positrons). 
In order to get realistic data description at DESY beam energies all scattering material between sensitive planes has to be taken into account. 
The precision of the track prediction at the DUT (plane \#3) based on five other telescope planes is shown in Figure\,\ref{fig:resolution}. 
The combination of the thickness of the telescope planes ($\unit{50}{\upmu\meter}$) with their hit position precision ($\sim\unit{3.5}{\upmu\meter}$)
 when minimising the distances to the Detector Under Test (DUT), 
 allows to sustain track pointing precision below $\unit{3}{\upmu\meter}$ for all electron (positron) energies above 2\,GeV and distance to the DUT shorter then 20\,mm (Figure\,\ref{fig:resolution}).
